    <!-- General instructions about how to use the Study Safe device -->
    <p>Follow the steps below to get started with your Study Safe device:</p>

    <ol>
      <!-- Step 1: Set up the device -->
      <li><strong>Set up your Study Safe device:</strong> Connect the device to power and ensure it is turned on. Make sure the accelerometer is properly connected.</li>

      <!-- Step 2: Connect to Wi-Fi -->
      <li><strong>Connect the device to Wi-Fi:</strong> Follow the on-screen prompts to connect the device to a Wi-Fi network. You'll need to input the network's SSID and password.</li>

      <!-- Step 3: Enter phone number -->
      <li><strong>Enter your phone number:</strong> Input your phone number so that you can receive alerts in case of unauthorized movement. Ensure the number is in the correct format (e.g., +16471234567).</li>

      <!-- Step 4: Activate the system -->
      <li><strong>Activate the monitoring system:</strong> Once connected, you can toggle between 'Away Mode' and 'With Device Mode'. 'Away Mode' will monitor for unauthorized movement, while 'With Device Mode' will deactivate the alarm.</li>

      <!-- Step 5: Receive alerts -->
      <li><strong>Receive real-time alerts:</strong> If movement is detected in 'Away Mode', an alarm will sound, and you will receive an SMS alert on your phone.</li>
    </ol>
