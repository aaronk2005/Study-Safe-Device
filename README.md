# Study-Safe-Device
This project involves designing an anti-theft device using Arduino and an accelerometer to detect unauthorized movement of personal belongings. The system triggers alarms and sends real-time SMS alerts via Twilio. The frontend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and WebSocket for remote monitoring and control.
